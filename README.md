An experiment to learn RESP, the Redis wire protocol. The Node.js server acts like a Redis server and writes the data to an hstore row in a Postgres database. It works surprisingly well.

## Why?

It was fun. And it was an excuse to learn more Postgres and Redis.

## Neon Serverless Driver?

You could absolutely use the normal Postgres driver here. I work at Neon and I wanted to work more with the serverless driver.
